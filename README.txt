Extra credit completed:

Added 3 new projectile types that are spawned by pressing Z X C
Z spawns a big projectile that is slow, but destroys everything in its path.
X spawns a projectile that explodes into multiple smaller projectiles
C spawns a fast projectile that bounces off world bounds, doesn't get destroyed. (It also does double the normal projectile damage)
Added a function for enemy planes to move around by pressing G
